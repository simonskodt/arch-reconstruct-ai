      "- Activity: crepuscular—peaks in early morning and evening; use these times for interaction and exercise.\n",
      "- Environment: protect from heat; ensure ventilation, shade, and cool surfaces.\n",
      "- Healthcare: preventive care includes spaying/neutering, nail trims, grooming for long-haired breeds, and daily monitoring of hay intake and stool/fecal output (early changes can signal problems like GI stasis).\n",
      "- Social needs: bonded pairs or small groups help reduce loneliness, but monitor for behavior issues like barbering or resource guarding.\n",
      "- Housing: cross-species housing is generally discouraged due to dietary and health differences.\n",
      "- Early health signs: changes in vocalization, posture, foraging, weight, or pellet/feces consistency can indicate health issues.\n",
