      "## Motivation Behind This Repository\n",
      "\n",
      "Our thesis focuses on agentic AI systems. After exploring various frameworks for developing agentic AI (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, SmolAgents, Pydantic AI, Agno, n8n, etc.), we decided to build our own agentic AI system. We have all completed the Software Architecture course which introduced us to architectural reconstruction. This process requires running several different tools and possessing substantial knowledge to obtain an architectural view of the system. Therefore, we considered the processes of architectural reconstruction as an ideal challenge to be solved by an agentic AI system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How Does It Work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Users can run our application against a repository, and the agentic AI system will collaborate with the human driver to develop an understanding of the codebase. The system collects general data, leverages domain-specific knowledge on architectural reconstruction, and invokes relevant tools to generate comprehensive documentation describing the system's architecture from multiple viewpoints. The views we initially aim to provide are described in \"The 3+1 Approach to Software Architecture Description Using UML,\" namely:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"A **Module viewpoint** concerned with how functionality of the system maps\n",
      "to static development units,\n",
      "- a **Component & Connector** viewpoint concerned with the runtime mapping\n",
      "of functionality to components of the architecture, and\n",
      "- an **Allocation viewpoint** concerned with how software entities are mapped\n",
      "to environmental entities\"\n",

      "    Architectural reconstruction is the process of recovering, documenting, and understanding the architectural design of an existing software system.
